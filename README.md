# Koura for Katerina

Theres a problem with node-sass
gulp seems pretty underused these days.
It really wants to run on node-sass which is depricated

Can I just get the sass running through any other version of Parcel etc

I need to update a few pieces and really need to document this

``` % sass --watch scss/app.scss css/app.css ```



## Images

The images are locked to a size so if they are a 2:3 vertical image ratio when uploaded they will stretch this can be fixed on some browsers with aspect ratio css or JS as a fallback 66% adoption as of April 2021 without Safari as the main problem.
