# Koura for Katerina
Koura is a Maori translation for gold

Theres something about the max-width: 75rem breaking the footer

I'm removing foundation and gulp
Going back to a local sass build

``` % sass --watch scss/app.scss css/app.css ```

``` % sass --style=compressed scss/app.scss css/app.css ```

The way I'm developing will be with a pattern lab for hot module reload

## Images

The images are locked to a size so if they are a 2:3 vertical image ratio when uploaded they will stretch this can be fixed on some browsers with aspect ratio css or JS as a fallback 66% adoption as of April 2021 without Safari as the main problem.

## To Do

- documentate all the things
- add designs to zepplin if i have the most recent
- add to dos to git hub and fix
- offline development, is this due to missing plugins?
- bring in prettier for editing
- remove foundation and gulp
- theres woocommerce themes that are behind and need fixing
- css I need to document things like which styles are overwritting a wordpress style
- rename branch to main
- remove flaxen naming
- look at some of the work done in new themes to easily update
- get rid of global styles
- /scss/off-canvas.scss is a foundation pull through this can be dealt with in a lot better ways
